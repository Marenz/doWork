# Do Work 

DoWork is a small helper tool that I wrote for me personally to keep me aware of how I spend my time.

It is quite simple really: As soon as the program runs, it locks your mouse and keyboard, forcing you to enter into the program what you now want to do and how long you think it probably takes. After pressing return, the program simply disappears until the time you entered is up.

The effect that I am aiming for is: 

* You consciously think about what you want to do now.
* You cannot just click it away, it forces you to type something in.

# Downloading

You can get it from the release page or just use this direct link: https://github.com/Marenz/doWork/releases/download/v0.1/doWork.7z

# Compiling

Easiest way to compile is to just open the QtCreator project and use the GUI.


# Later plans

* I might implement a small snooze so that you can press ESC and it will give you 2 minutes of peace.
* A server backend so that you can use it with several computers
* Recording of what you enter according with the time you entered and the duration you guessed
* Auto completetion based on your past records
* An 'extend current task' functionality
